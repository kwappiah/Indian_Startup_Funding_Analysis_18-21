# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

In this project, our objective was to ascertain whether there is a relationship between the funding received by a startup in the Indian ecosystem and the sector to which it belongs. 
I used python and jupyter for this project

# Column names and description
 Company/Brand: Name of the company/startup. String
 Founded: Year startup was founded. String 
 Sector: Sector of operation. String 
 What it does: Description of Company. String
 Founders: Founders of the Company. String 
 Investor: Investors. String 
 Amount($): Funds raised. Float 
 Stage: Round of funding. String 

 # Hypotheses
 Ho: there is no relationship between the sector a startup belongs to and the type of funding received
 Ha: there is a relationship between the sector a startup belongs to and the type of funding received

 # Conclusion
 Fail to reject the null hypothesis.
